\begin{abstract}
Finding information on how people use built-in Excel functions individually is easy; how they're used together is not. With no analysis of functions in conjunction, a dearth on information about how end users construct more sophisticated programs within spreadsheets restricts current research. I've developed a visualization tool, informed by existing spreadsheet corpora, which offers insight into the patterns of how formulas comprise several functions in practice. Even in its initial state, the tool illustrates how some people think that have 27 arguments in a single SUM function is, for whatever reason, a good idea.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
The world of business owes a considerable debt to spreadsheets, the table-based interface which enables organization and manipulation of massive amounts of data. Their allure is in their versatility: while the end user does not need sophisticated programming skills to fill out a spreadsheet, the expert user has at their disposal numerous built-in operations, or functions, to expedite their work. As such, it should be of little surprise when Scaffidi and colleagues estimated that by 2012, over 50 million workers could be using them, including the 25 million who would be writing programs out of the functions included (citation and such).\par

Considering this ubiquity, it's crucial to get spreadsheets right. Something, something. \par

Fortunately, the vanguards of spreadsheet research have assembled, organized, and released a number of spreadsheet corpora to inform work on how people actually use these tools in different contexts. Collections like EUSES[yada], FUSE[yada], and the Enron corpus[yada] have already enabled fruitful work across the field: [WORK PENDING MORE RESEARCH]. A number of these studies focus on discovering which built-in functions are the most common (enabling something). \par

This paper presents a tool, informed by such variegated sources, that visualizes not how people employ individual Excel functions but how they combine to make more sophisticated shreadsheet formulas. 


\section{Related Work}
Spreadsheets, being a core component of business that they are, have prompted the development of many tools to evaluate them and their many qualities. [RESEARCH ON NON-VISUAL ANALYSIS TOOLS] \par
Furthermore, this tool comes from a line of spreadsheet visualization tools before it, each with a different focus. For example, Breviz, developed by Hermans and colleagues, uses visualization to illustrate workbook dataflow to address the need for a clearly communicable representation of spreadsheets as they move from person to person. \par
Other studies focus on API and built-in function use outside the domain of spreadsheets. [BUT FIRST I HAVE TO FIND THEM]  

\section{Approach}
In visualizing the spreadsheet data, I aimed to accomplish the following goals:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The data should come from a varied enough sources to avoid having too narrow or specialized a scope.
	\item The tool should accommodate dataset sizes from the single spreadsheet to corpora of thousands.
	\item The tool should visualize as much data as possible in order to capture (and clearly indicate) both the most typical and the most anomalous cases...
	\item ...while being interactive enough to let the user choose which cases they see, as to not sacrifice readability.
	\item The tool should facilitate quantitative understanding by showing which functions and which combinations are used most frequently...
	\item ...and it should facilitate qualitative understanding by incorporating actual examples into the visualization from the datasets it studies, and it should help the user find these examples in their original context.
	\item The tool, by the same method as above, should thus guide a user from the abstract patterns of function usage into the specific and applied techniques of functions in their natural habitat.
\end{itemize} \par
Likewise, there were a few goals that I was specifically not trying to accomplish with this:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The tool should not be, by itself, responsible for generating functions from the data it collects. It is purely analytical.
	%TODO: I do have an idea which could actually do the below, but, eh, it would take
	%TODO: a fair amount of time to implement.
	\item The tool will not visualize isolated Excel functions, linking the specific instance to the abstract pattern. It works only the other way.
	\item Likewise, the tool will make no effort to explain what any given set of functions in combination actually does; the function of any given example is up to the user to infer.
\end{itemize}

\section{Case Study}
The patient exhibits strong cadaverous tendencies.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper is the end-all, be-all. There is no future work simply because the concept of future work cannot exist with reference to this paper. The work is done. I perfected it. Go home, kiss your love, kick back, call it a day. This is not just a good thing, but the best thing. Your job here is done, and I'm the one who did it.
