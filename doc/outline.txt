Abstract
	-Four sentence abstract (https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~migod/research/beckOOPSLA.html)

Introduction
	-Establish importance / current situation
	-Spreadsheets are important
		-Bugs cost money
		-
	-Lots of corpora/spreadsheets available 
		-ENRON, EUSES, FUSE
		-Useful for variety of purposes
		-How are they useful? Provide examples? 
		-Researchers? Practitioners?
		-(Code smells?)
		-Looking for anomalies in function organization spreadsheets

	-We present a tool that...<connects to above>
		-Helps researchers understand functions better
		-(connect explicitly to above)
		-STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION

	[[Sentence to start -- The three related areas to this are yada yada yada
			    -- each area a paragraph
			    -- sentence on why it's similar to ours (There are existing approaches to analyzes spreadsheets)
			    -- Per paper : what they did, what they found
			    -- 3, 5, 10 most related
			    -- Final sentence: in contrast to this work, ours... (does something different)
			    -- Option: how it differs from each paper individually, but could be painful]]

Approach (not methodology)
	((Get Ubuntu VM with everything preloaded)) [worth no more than a day]
	What were the design goals? (More than "Visualize the data")
		-The technique should enable the exploration of formulas across a wide dataset
		-Scalability/Interactivity
		-Associate high-level summary (going from pattern to specific)
		-enable understanding frequent patterns of function use and also find anomalous function use
		-enable quantitative function usage analysis
		-qualitatively understand function usage (linking to example)

	What is NOT a design goal
		-Going from specific to pattern
	What it produces as output and how to interpret it -- what is each node? weights? etc
							   -- what are affordances? limitations?
	Analysis steps that are involved -- example: if r1c1 uniqueness done
					 -- apache poi
					 -- link to the tool on GitHub
	Examples -- links to graphs for each corpora (or combined)
	Limitations/trade-offs (what prevents us from reach design goals):
		Syntactically invalid functions are lost
		
		 
Case Study -- What I learned about the data
	-Range number of arguments for functions (SUM has 1 to 27)
	-How [often] do certain functions use recursion?
	-Things that seem wrong
Conclusion/Future work
	-Enable personality analysis by usage

Questions:
	What function is used most here?
	What formula is used more here? Formula diversity?
