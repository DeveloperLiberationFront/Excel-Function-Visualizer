Approach to finding formulas:
	Use Apache POI's provided Formula Parser
	
	Create a workbook for each spreadsheet
		74 threw errors when trying to open: isolated
		15855 work well: proceed
		(Option to try again with erring 74: open)
		(Format in which files must be opened lest corruption: read-only)
		
	Iterate over sheets -> rows -> cells for formula-type cells:
		Formulas too long to fit in database's 900-character (somewhat arbitrary) limit: 172
			(Reasons why I can't change limit and include them: 0)
		Formulas unparsable by POI (whether for third-party function use or other reasons): 198401
			(Example: Name '_xludf.EOMONTH' is completely unknown in the current workbook)
		Reference-only formulas: 2981818
		Valid formulas: 17585500
		R1C1 unique formulas: ???????
		Time it took Lenovo to go upload to database: like, 10 hours or something (11pm ~ 9am)
		Time it would've taken the HP laptop: project 9ish days (2 million records in 24 hours)
		
				
NOTE: This file would probably fare better as a spreadsheet, as it goes.
		
	Testing method:
		Get the formula out of the cell
		Parse it down to tokens (in RPN)
		Piece tokens back into a single string 
		Compare new string with initial formula string
			(with some formatting on either side to normalize some non-essential formula changes 
			in process, like less whitespace)
